# HackAZ

A secured and distributed blockchain based object tracking system developed for Hack Arizona 2018. The prototype used Google 
Optical Character Recognition to capture license plate numbers and store the information along with the location in a 
distributed ledger. Searching and tracking the location of a car in the blockchain structure was achieved in O(1) time 
complexity using a Hash Map.
